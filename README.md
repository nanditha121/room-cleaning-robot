Around 2 years back I made a Floor Cleaning Robot (CleanSweep) from scratch But that design actually had some flaws. So this year I had to make my Engineering Mini Project and I decided to work on the same idea but with some improvements.

This is Version 2.0 of the Floor Cleaning Robot, with some improvements over the previous version. This one is also controlled from a phone app via bluetooth but here I have also added autonomous control (which a lot of people requested). I used 3 ultrasonic sensors- one looks at the front, one looks left and one looks right. A latching switch is used to switch between Autonomous and Manual Mode. The roller at the back was useless so I removed it. The 2 rotating mops at the front obstructed movement so I replaced that with a single fixed mop. Apart from that I also added an LCD display (which is optional) for displaying commands or debugging. I also used lithium-ion batteries instead of a bulky lead acid battery which gives us more capacity and smaller size. We can also control the flow of water for which I used glucose drip infusion mechanism.

In short here are the changes I made compared to the previous version:

.Added Autonomous Mode

.Fixed mop instead of rotating ones

.Removed roller and servo motor
.Added LCD Display
.Used Lithium-ion Batteries instead of lead acid
.Used Arduino Nano (cheaper and smaller in size) instead of Uno
.Added Water Flow Control
